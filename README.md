# March Madness with Machine Learning (2025)

Welcome to my March Madness 2025 repository! This repository contains all the code and data I used to train a model to assist with the creation of my bracket for 2025 and entering the Kaggle [March Machine Learning Mania 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/).

## Data Preprocessing
For 2025 I have decided only to use [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/data) provided by kaggle to avoid having to handle any team spelling differences across datasets. Kaggle has very nicely assigned UIDs to each team to keep track of them throughout the seasons and without comparing strings.
